# Bootstrap-Portfolio---Module-3-Challenge

## Creation of a central portfolio to showcase my work to prospective employers.

My motivation for this project is to create a portfolio of my work using bootstrap elements which prospective employers can view.

I would like a central location to showcase my work so that when I apply for jobs my work can be easily viewed to support any job applications.

Having a purpose built portfolio means that I can simplify job applications by directing people to this webpage. By using Bootstrap to develop this portfolio I can create smart designs which support my requirements.

During this project I learnt how to use Bootstrap elements to create my design and also how to adapt these elements to my own style choices.
